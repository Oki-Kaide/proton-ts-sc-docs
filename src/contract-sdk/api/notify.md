### requireRecipient
* ```ts
  function requireRecipient(name: Name): void
  ```
  Add the specified account to set of accounts to be notified about transaction

  <sub>**Example:**</sub>
  ```ts
  @action('transfer')
  transferTokens(
    payer: Name,
    buyer: Name
  ): void {
    requireRecipient(payer);
    requireRecipient(buyer);
    // do tokens transfer from payer to buyer
  }
  ```

### readActionData
* ```ts
  function readActionData(): u8[]
  ```
  Users interact with the chain by sending a transaction.A transaction is essentially an array of actions that are executed sequentially.
  
  `readActionData` allows you to read the data passed in for the current action. The data is packed, so you need to unpack it before using.
  
  In most cases you don't need to do it, as the framework will handle it for you automatically. And you'll get unpacked values as action arguments
